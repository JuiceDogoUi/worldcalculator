    "whatIsTitle": "What is Compound Interest?",
    "whatIsContent": "Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal and all previously accumulated interest. Unlike simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal, compound interest grows exponentially over time. This powerful concept is often called the 'eighth wonder of the world' because it can significantly multiply your wealth over long periods.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?",
    "faq1Answer": "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal, while compound interest is calculated on both the principal and accumulated interest. For example, $1,000 at 10% simple interest earns $100 per year. With compound interest, the second year earns interest on $1,100, not just $1,000.",
    "faq2Question": "How often should interest compound for best results?",
    "faq2Answer": "More frequent compounding yields higher returns. Daily compounding gives the best results, followed by monthly, quarterly, and annually. However, the difference between daily and monthly compounding is typically small (less than 0.5% per year on most rates).",
    "faq3Question": "What is APY and how is it different from APR?",
    "faq3Answer": "APY (Annual Percentage Yield) includes the effect of compounding, showing your actual yearly return. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the simple interest rate without compounding. APY is always equal to or higher than APR for the same nominal rate.",
    "faq4Question": "How does the Rule of 72 work?",
    "faq4Answer": "The Rule of 72 is a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money. Divide 72 by your interest rate to get the approximate years. For example, at 8% interest, your money doubles in roughly 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years.",
    "faq5Question": "Why do regular contributions matter so much?",
    "faq5Answer": "Regular contributions create a snowball effect. Each contribution starts earning compound interest immediately, and over time, the accumulated contributions and their interest can exceed the growth from the initial principal alone.",
    "faq6Question": "What is a realistic rate of return to expect?",
    "faq6Answer": "Historical stock market returns average 7-10% annually (before inflation). Savings accounts typically offer 0.5-5% depending on economic conditions. Bonds usually fall between these ranges. Always consider fees and taxes when projecting returns.",
    "faq7Question": "Should I factor in inflation?",
    "faq7Answer": "Yes, inflation reduces purchasing power over time. A 7% return with 3% inflation gives a 'real' return of about 4%. For long-term planning, consider using inflation-adjusted (real) returns for more accurate projections.",
    "faq8Question": "How can I use this calculator for retirement planning?",
    "faq8Answer": "Enter your current savings as principal, your expected annual return rate, years until retirement, and your planned monthly contributions. The result shows your projected retirement savings. Adjust the variables to see how different scenarios affect your outcome."
