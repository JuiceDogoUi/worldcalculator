    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the 4% rule for retirement?",
    "faq1Answer": "The 4% rule is a guideline suggesting you can withdraw 4% of your retirement savings in the first year, then adjust for inflation annually. Based on the Trinity Study, this approach historically provided a high probability that savings would last 30 years. However, consider your specific situation, as lower withdrawal rates (3-3.5%) may be more conservative.",
    "faq2Question": "How much should I have saved for retirement?",
    "faq2Answer": "A common guideline is to have 10-12 times your annual salary saved by retirement age. For example, if you earn $80,000/year, aim for $800,000-$960,000. However, your actual needs depend on your expected expenses, Social Security benefits, pension income, and desired lifestyle in retirement.",
    "faq3Question": "What return rate should I expect?",
    "faq3Answer": "Historically, a diversified stock portfolio has returned about 7% annually after inflation. A more conservative portfolio with bonds might return 4-5%. During retirement, many people shift to a more conservative allocation (4-5% expected return) to protect their savings. Be cautious with projections using returns above 8%.",
    "faq4Question": "When should I start saving for retirement?",
    "faq4Answer": "As early as possible! Starting at 25 versus 35 can result in nearly twice as much savings at retirement due to compound interest. Even small contributions in your 20s can grow significantly. If you're starting later, you may need to contribute more aggressively to catch up.",
    "faq5Question": "Should I include Social Security in my calculations?",
    "faq5Answer": "Yes, but be conservative. Social Security typically replaces 30-40% of pre-retirement income for average earners. You can estimate your benefits at ssa.gov. Many planners suggest treating Social Security as a bonus rather than relying on it entirely, given potential future benefit changes.",
    "faq6Question": "How does inflation affect retirement planning?",
    "faq6Answer": "Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. At 3% inflation, $100 today will only buy about $55 worth of goods in 20 years. Our calculator shows your savings in both future dollars and today's dollars so you can see the real purchasing power of your retirement savings.",
    "faq7Question": "What if my savings won't last through retirement?",
    "faq7Answer": "If projections show a shortfall, you have several options: increase your monthly contributions, delay retirement to save more and allow additional growth, plan to work part-time in retirement, reduce expected retirement expenses, or consider a lower withdrawal rate. Even small adjustments can make a significant difference over time.",
    "faq8Question": "How accurate is this retirement calculator?",
    "faq8Answer": "This calculator provides estimates based on the inputs you provide and assumes steady returns. Real-world results vary due to market volatility, changing circumstances, taxes, and fees. Use this as a planning tool, not a guarantee. Review your plan regularly and consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance."
