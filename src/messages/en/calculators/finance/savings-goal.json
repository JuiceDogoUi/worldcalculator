    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How much should I save each month?",
    "faq1Answer": "This depends on your goal, timeline, and current savings. Financial experts typically recommend saving 20% of your income, but the right amount varies by person. Use the 'Required Deposit' mode to calculate exactly how much you need to save based on your specific goal and timeframe.",
    "faq2Question": "What's a realistic interest rate for savings?",
    "faq2Answer": "High-yield savings accounts currently offer 4-5% APY, traditional savings accounts offer 0.5-1%, and investment accounts historically average 7-10% annually (with higher risk). Choose a conservative rate for short-term goals and can use higher rates for long-term investment goals.",
    "faq3Question": "Should I save weekly, biweekly, or monthly?",
    "faq3Answer": "The best frequency matches your income schedule. If you're paid biweekly, save biweekly. More frequent deposits mean interest starts compounding sooner, but the difference is minimal. The most important factor is consistency - choose what you can stick with.",
    "faq4Question": "How do I account for current savings?",
    "faq4Answer": "Enter your current savings in the 'Current Savings' field. The calculator will factor in compound interest on this amount plus your regular deposits. Even small existing savings can significantly reduce how much you need to deposit regularly.",
    "faq5Question": "What if I can't afford the required deposit amount?",
    "faq5Answer": "You have three options: extend your timeline (use 'Time to Goal' mode with a lower deposit), increase your expected return rate (consider investment accounts instead of savings), or adjust your goal amount. Small increases in timeframe can dramatically reduce required deposits.",
    "faq6Question": "How does deposit frequency affect my goal?",
    "faq6Answer": "More frequent deposits (weekly vs. monthly) slightly accelerate goal achievement because money starts earning interest sooner. However, the difference is usually small - a few weeks to months. Choose the frequency that matches your income and is easiest to maintain.",
    "faq7Question": "Should I include inflation in my calculations?",
    "faq7Answer": "For long-term goals (5+ years), yes. If you need $50,000 in 10 years, inflation might mean you actually need $60,000+ in future dollars. Either increase your goal amount by 2-3% per year, or reduce your expected interest rate by the inflation rate to get 'real' returns.",
    "faq8Question": "Can I use this for retirement savings?",
    "faq8Answer": "Yes! Enter your retirement target as the goal, current retirement savings, expected return rate (6-8% for diversified portfolios), and years until retirement. The calculator shows required monthly contributions. Remember to factor in employer matches and adjust for inflation on long timeframes."
