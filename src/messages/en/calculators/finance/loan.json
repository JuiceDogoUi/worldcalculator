    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What factors affect my loan payment?",
    "faq1Answer": "Your payment is determined by three main factors: the loan amount (principal), the interest rate, and the loan term. A larger loan, higher interest rate, or shorter term will result in higher payments. Payment frequency also affects the amount - weekly payments are smaller than monthly but total more payments per year.",
    "faq2Question": "Should I choose a shorter or longer loan term?",
    "faq2Answer": "Shorter terms (2-3 years) mean higher payments but significantly less total interest and faster debt freedom. Longer terms (5-7 years) offer more affordable payments but cost much more in total interest. Choose based on your budget flexibility and financial goals.",
    "faq3Question": "How does payment frequency affect my loan?",
    "faq3Answer": "More frequent payments (bi-weekly or weekly) can help you pay off your loan faster and reduce total interest. Bi-weekly payments result in 26 half-payments per year, equivalent to 13 monthly payments instead of 12, potentially shortening your loan by years.",
    "faq4Question": "What's the difference between APR and interest rate?",
    "faq4Answer": "The interest rate is the cost of borrowing the principal. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) includes the interest rate plus additional fees like origination fees, closing costs, or insurance. APR gives you the true cost of a loan, making it easier to compare offers from different lenders.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I pay off my loan early without penalty?",
    "faq5Answer": "Many loans allow early repayment, but some lenders charge prepayment penalties to recoup lost interest. Always check your loan agreement for prepayment terms before borrowing. Making extra payments can save thousands in interest if no penalty applies.",
    "faq6Question": "What is an amortization schedule?",
    "faq6Answer": "An amortization schedule breaks down each loan payment, showing how much goes toward principal versus interest. Early payments are mostly interest, while later payments pay down more principal. This schedule helps you understand your loan's payoff timeline and the impact of extra payments.",
    "faq7Question": "How much loan can I afford?",
    "faq7Answer": "A general rule is to keep your total monthly debt payments below 36% of your gross income. Use this calculator to test different loan amounts and see which payment fits your budget. Consider other expenses, emergency savings, and financial goals before committing to a loan amount.",
    "faq8Question": "What credit score do I need for the best loan rates?",
    "faq8Answer": "Credit scores above 720 typically qualify for the best interest rates. Scores between 650-719 may qualify for decent rates, while scores below 650 often face higher rates or require secured loans. Improving your credit score by even 20-30 points can save hundreds or thousands in interest.",
    "faq9Question": "Is this calculator accurate for all loan types?",
    "faq9Answer": "This calculator works for any fixed-rate installment loan with regular payments - including personal loans, auto loans, student loans, and mortgages. It may not be accurate for variable-rate loans, credit cards with revolving balances, or loans with balloon payments. For exact terms, always consult your lender."
