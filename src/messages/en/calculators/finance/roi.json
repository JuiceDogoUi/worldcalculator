    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is a good ROI?",
    "faq1Answer": "A 'good' ROI depends on the investment type and risk level. For stocks, the S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually. Real estate typically targets 8-12% annually. High-risk investments may require 15%+ to compensate for increased volatility. Always compare ROI to risk-free alternatives like savings accounts or treasury bonds.",
    "faq2Question": "How do I calculate ROI?",
    "faq2Answer": "ROI is calculated as: ((Final Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment) × 100. For example, if you invest $10,000 and it grows to $12,500, your ROI is ((12,500 - 10,000) / 10,000) × 100 = 25%. This percentage represents your profit relative to your initial investment.",
    "faq3Question": "What is the difference between ROI and annualized ROI?",
    "faq3Answer": "Simple ROI shows total return regardless of time. Annualized ROI (CAGR) converts the return to an annual rate, allowing fair comparison between investments held for different periods. A 50% total return over 5 years equals about 8.45% annualized, while 50% in 1 year is much better at 50% annualized.",
    "faq4Question": "Can ROI be negative?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, ROI is negative when you lose money on an investment. If you invest $10,000 and the value drops to $8,000, your ROI is -20%. Negative ROI indicates a loss, and the percentage shows how much of your original investment was lost.",
    "faq5Question": "Should I include dividends in my ROI calculation?",
    "faq5Answer": "Yes! For accurate ROI on stocks, include all returns: capital appreciation, dividends, and any other distributions. Add dividend income to your final value before calculating. This gives you the 'total return' which represents your actual investment performance.",
    "faq6Question": "How does ROI differ from other investment metrics?",
    "faq6Answer": "ROI measures simple percentage return. Related metrics include: IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for irregular cash flows, NPV (Net Present Value) for time-value of money, and Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted returns. Each metric serves different analytical purposes.",
    "faq7Question": "What costs should I include when calculating investment ROI?",
    "faq7Answer": "Include all costs: purchase commissions, management fees, trading costs, taxes, and any other expenses. For real estate, include closing costs, maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. True ROI accounts for every dollar spent on the investment.",
    "faq8Question": "How often should I calculate my investment ROI?",
    "faq8Answer": "Review ROI quarterly or annually for long-term investments. More frequent calculations may lead to emotional decisions. For active trading, track ROI per trade. Annual reviews help assess progress toward financial goals while avoiding reactionary moves to short-term volatility.",
    "faq9Question": "Is ROI the only metric I should use to evaluate investments?",
    "faq9Answer": "No. ROI doesn't account for risk, time value of money, or opportunity cost. Consider using multiple metrics: ROI for simple comparison, CAGR for annualized performance, Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted returns, and benchmark comparisons for relative performance.",
    "faq10Question": "What ROI benchmarks should I use for comparison?",
    "faq10Answer": "Common benchmarks include: S&P 500 (~10% historical annual return), inflation rate (2-3%), savings account rates (0.5-5%), and 10-year Treasury bonds (~4-5%). Your required ROI should exceed inflation and ideally beat passive index fund returns to justify active investment decisions."
