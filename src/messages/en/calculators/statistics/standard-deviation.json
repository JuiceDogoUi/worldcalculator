    "whatIsTitle": "What is Standard Deviation?",
    "whatIsContent": "Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a data set. A low standard deviation indicates that data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that data points are spread out over a wider range. It's one of the most commonly used statistics in data analysis, research, quality control, and finance.",
    "typesTitle": "Population vs Sample Standard Deviation",
    "typesIntro": "There are two types of standard deviation depending on your data:",
    "type1": "Population Standard Deviation (σ) – Use when you have data for the entire population or when you only care about the specific data set at hand. Divides by N (total count).",
    "type2": "Sample Standard Deviation (s) – Use when you have a sample from a larger population and want to estimate the population's standard deviation. Divides by n-1 (Bessel's correction) to reduce bias.",

    "formula1Name": "Population Standard Deviation",
    "formula1": "σ = √[Σ(xi - μ)² / N]",
    "formula1Example": "Where σ is the population standard deviation, μ is the population mean, xi is each value, and N is the total count",
    "formula2Name": "Sample Standard Deviation",
    "formula2": "s = √[Σ(xi - x̄)² / (n-1)]",
    "formula2Example": "Where s is the sample standard deviation, x̄ is the sample mean, xi is each value, and n-1 is Bessel's correction",
    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Understanding Standard Deviation",
    "tip1": "About 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean (empirical rule for normal distributions)",
    "tip2": "About 95% of data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean",
    "tip3": "A standard deviation of 0 means all values are identical",
    "tip4": "Use sample standard deviation when generalizing from a subset to a larger population",
    "tip5": "The coefficient of variation (CV) allows comparing variability across data sets with different means",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the difference between population and sample standard deviation?",
    "faq1Answer": "Population standard deviation (σ) is used when you have data for the entire population and divides by N. Sample standard deviation (s) is used when you have a sample from a larger population and divides by n-1 (Bessel's correction) to provide an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation.",
    "faq2Question": "Can standard deviation be negative?",
    "faq2Answer": "No, standard deviation cannot be negative. Since it involves squaring the deviations (which makes them positive) and then taking a square root, the result is always zero or positive. A standard deviation of 0 only occurs when all values in the data set are identical.",
    "faq3Question": "What does a standard deviation of zero mean?",
    "faq3Answer": "A standard deviation of zero means there is no variation in the data—all values are exactly the same. For example, the data set '{'5, 5, 5, 5, 5'}' has a standard deviation of 0 because every value equals the mean.",
    "faq4Question": "Why does sample standard deviation use n-1 instead of n?",
    "faq4Answer": "Sample standard deviation uses n-1 (called Bessel's correction) to correct for bias when estimating population standard deviation from a sample. Using n would consistently underestimate the true population standard deviation. The n-1 divisor produces an unbiased estimate.",
    "faq5Question": "What is a 'good' standard deviation?",
    "faq5Answer": "There's no universal 'good' or 'bad' standard deviation—it depends entirely on context. A better measure is the coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean × 100%), which expresses variability relative to the mean. In quality control, lower SD is typically desired. In finance, some volatility (SD) may be acceptable for higher returns.",
    "faq6Question": "What is the relationship between variance and standard deviation?",
    "faq6Answer": "Variance is the square of standard deviation (or conversely, standard deviation is the square root of variance). Variance is measured in squared units, while standard deviation is in the original units of measurement, making it more interpretable.",
    "faq7Question": "What is Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)?",
    "faq7Answer": "Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) measures how precisely the sample mean estimates the population mean. It equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (SEM = s/√n). Smaller SEM indicates more precise estimation.",
    "faq8Question": "What is the empirical rule (68-95-99.7)?",
    "faq8Answer": "For normally distributed data, approximately 68% of values fall within 1 SD of the mean, 95% within 2 SDs, and 99.7% within 3 SDs. This rule helps interpret what standard deviation values mean in practical terms."
