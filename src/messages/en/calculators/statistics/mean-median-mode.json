    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Mean, Median, Mode Calculator?",
    "whatIsContent": "A mean, median, mode calculator is a statistical tool that helps you find the three main measures of central tendency in a data set. The mean (average) is the sum divided by the count, the median is the middle value when sorted, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value. These measures help summarize and understand data distributions, making them essential for statistics, data analysis, research, and everyday problem-solving.",

    "measuresIntro": "Understanding when to use each measure is key to proper data analysis:",
    "measure1Name": "Mean (Average)",
    "measure1Desc": "The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding all values and dividing by the count. It's sensitive to outliers but provides a good overall measure when data is normally distributed.",
    "measure2Name": "Median (Middle Value)",
    "measure2Desc": "The median is the middle value when data is sorted. It's resistant to outliers and better represents typical values in skewed distributions.",
    "measure3Name": "Mode (Most Frequent)",
    "measure3Desc": "The mode is the value that appears most often. Data can be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), multimodal, or have no mode if all values appear equally.",
    "whenToUseTitle": "When to Use Each Measure",
    "whenToUseIntro": "Choose the right measure of central tendency based on your data characteristics:",
    "useCase1": "Use mean for normally distributed data without significant outliers",
    "useCase2": "Use median when your data has outliers or is skewed (like income data)",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the difference between mean, median, and mode?",
    "faq1Answer": "Mean is the average (sum divided by count), median is the middle value when sorted, and mode is the most frequent value. Each measure gives different insights: mean considers all values, median resists outliers, and mode shows the most common value.",
    "faq2Question": "When should I use median instead of mean?",
    "faq2Answer": "Use median when your data has outliers or is skewed. For example, income data often uses median because a few very high incomes can inflate the mean. The median better represents the typical value in such cases.",
    "faq3Question": "Can there be more than one mode?",
    "faq3Answer": "Yes. Data is unimodal with one mode, bimodal with two modes, or multimodal with more than two modes. If all values appear equally, there is no mode.",
    "faq4Question": "What is a weighted mean?",
    "faq4Answer": "A weighted mean gives different importance to values based on their weights. It's used when some values matter more, like calculating course grades where different assignments have different point values.",
    "faq5Question": "When should I use geometric mean?",
    "faq5Answer": "Use geometric mean for multiplicative growth rates, like investment returns or population growth. It's appropriate when values are percentages or ratios that compound together.",
    "faq6Question": "What is harmonic mean used for?",
    "faq6Answer": "Harmonic mean is used for averaging rates. For example, if you drive 60 mph one way and 40 mph back, the harmonic mean gives the correct average speed (48 mph), not the arithmetic mean (50 mph).",
    "faq7Question": "How do outliers affect mean, median, and mode?",
    "faq7Answer": "Outliers significantly affect the mean by pulling it toward extreme values. Median is resistant to outliers since it only depends on the middle position. Mode is unaffected by outliers unless they become the most frequent value.",
    "faq8Question": "What additional statistics does this calculator provide?",
    "faq8Answer": "Beyond mean, median, and mode, this calculator provides: count, sum, range (max - min), quartiles (Q1, Q3), interquartile range (IQR), variance, standard deviation, and a complete frequency distribution table."
