    "whatIsTitle": "What is Correlation?",
    "whatIsContent": "Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. Correlation is fundamental in statistics for understanding how variables move together and for predictive modeling.",
    "typesTitle": "Types of Correlation",
    "typesIntro": "Understanding correlation strength helps interpret your results:",
    "type1": "Strong correlation (|r| > 0.7): Variables are closely related, moving together predictably. One variable explains most of the variance in the other.",
    "type2": "Moderate correlation (0.4 < |r| ≤ 0.7): Variables are related but other factors also influence them. Useful for identifying trends.",
    "type3": "Weak correlation (|r| ≤ 0.4): Variables have limited relationship. Other factors dominate the variation.",
    "useCasesTitle": "Common Uses of Correlation Analysis",
    "useCase1": "Finance – Analyze portfolio diversification by measuring correlation between asset returns. Low correlation reduces risk.",
    "useCase2": "Medical Research – Study relationships between variables like blood pressure and cholesterol, or treatment dosage and outcomes.",
    "useCase3": "Social Sciences – Examine relationships between education and income, social media usage and well-being.",
    "useCase4": "Quality Control – Identify process variables that affect product quality through correlation analysis.",
    "useCase5": "Marketing – Measure correlation between advertising spend and sales, customer satisfaction and retention.",

    "formulasTitle": "Correlation Formulas",
    "formula1Name": "Pearson Correlation Coefficient",
    "formula1": "r = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² × Σ(yi - ȳ)²]",
    "formula1Example": "Where xi and yi are data points, x̄ and ȳ are means. This measures the linear relationship strength.",
    "formula2Name": "Coefficient of Determination",
    "formula2": "R² = r²",
    "formula2Example": "R² indicates the proportion of variance in Y explained by X. An R² of 0.81 means 81% of variance is explained.",
    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Correlation Analysis",
    "tip1": "Correlation measures linear relationships only. Non-linear patterns may show low r but still be strongly related.",
    "tip2": "Always visualize your data with a scatter plot before interpreting correlation.",
    "tip3": "Outliers can dramatically affect correlation. Check your data for anomalies.",
    "tip4": "Correlation does not imply causation. Two correlated variables may both be caused by a third factor.",
    "tip5": "Larger sample sizes provide more reliable correlation estimates. Small samples can show spurious correlations.",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is a good correlation coefficient?",
    "faq1Answer": "A 'good' correlation depends on your field. In physics, r > 0.9 might be expected. In social sciences, r > 0.5 is often considered strong. In finance, even r = 0.3 can be meaningful. Context matters more than arbitrary thresholds.",
    "faq2Question": "What is the difference between correlation and R²?",
    "faq2Answer": "Correlation (r) measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship (-1 to +1). R² is r squared (0 to 1) and represents the proportion of variance explained. For example, r = 0.9 means R² = 0.81, so 81% of variance is explained by the relationship.",
    "faq3Question": "Can correlation be negative?",
    "faq3Answer": "Yes, negative correlation means variables move in opposite directions. When one increases, the other decreases. For example, price and demand often show negative correlation. A correlation of -0.8 is just as strong as +0.8, but in the opposite direction.",
    "faq4Question": "How many data points do I need for meaningful correlation?",
    "faq4Answer": "Mathematically, you need at least 2 points, but for reliable results, more is better. With less than 10 points, correlation can be highly variable. For statistical significance testing, sample size directly affects p-values. General guideline: 30+ points for reliable estimates.",
    "faq5Question": "What does statistical significance mean for correlation?",
    "faq5Answer": "Statistical significance (p < 0.05) indicates the correlation is unlikely to be due to random chance. However, significance depends on sample size. Large samples can show 'significant' but weak correlations. Always consider both the p-value and the correlation magnitude.",
    "faq6Question": "How do I interpret the regression line?",
    "faq6Answer": "The regression line (y = mx + b) predicts Y values from X values. The slope (m) shows how much Y changes per unit change in X. The intercept (b) is the predicted Y when X = 0. Use this for making predictions within your data range.",
    "faq7Question": "Why is my correlation zero but my data looks related?",
    "faq7Answer": "Pearson correlation only measures linear relationships. If your data has a curved pattern (quadratic, exponential), the linear correlation may be near zero even though the variables are clearly related. Consider non-linear correlation methods like Spearman's rank correlation.",
    "faq8Question": "What are the limitations of correlation analysis?",
    "faq8Answer": "Key limitations: (1) Only measures linear relationships, (2) Sensitive to outliers, (3) Doesn't prove causation, (4) Assumes continuous variables, (5) Can be misleading with small samples. Always combine correlation analysis with domain knowledge and data visualization."
