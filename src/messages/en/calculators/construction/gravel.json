    "whatIsContent": "Calculating gravel requirements accurately is essential for any landscaping or construction project. Whether you're building a driveway, creating a patio base, or designing a garden path, knowing exactly how much gravel you need saves money and prevents project delays. Gravel is sold by cubic yard or by ton, and different types have different densities. Our calculator helps you determine the exact volume and weight needed, plus estimates costs for materials and delivery.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How much gravel do I need for a 10x10 area?",
    "faq1Answer": "For a 10×10 ft area at 3 inches deep, you need approximately 0.93 cubic yards or about 1.3 tons of gravel. For a 10×10 meter area at 7.5 cm deep, you need about 7.5 cubic meters or 12 metric tons.",
    "faq2Question": "How many tons of gravel in a cubic yard?",
    "faq2Answer": "This depends on gravel type. Pea gravel: ~1.3 tons per cubic yard. Crushed stone: ~1.35 tons. River rock: ~1.28 tons. Lava rock: only ~0.67 tons due to lower density.",
    "faq3Question": "How deep should gravel be for a driveway?",
    "faq3Answer": "A typical gravel driveway needs 4-6 inches of base gravel (crusher run) topped with 2-3 inches of finishing gravel. Total depth should be 6-9 inches for light traffic, up to 12 inches for heavy vehicles.",
    "faq4Question": "What is compaction factor for gravel?",
    "faq4Answer": "Compaction factor accounts for gravel settling when compacted. Typically 10-15% extra material is needed. Crushed stone compacts more (15%) than rounded gravel (10%) due to its angular shape.",
    "faq5Question": "How much does gravel delivery cost?",
    "faq5Answer": "Delivery typically costs $50-150 for local deliveries under 10 miles. Many suppliers include free delivery for orders over 5-10 tons. Per-ton delivery fees range from $10-20.",
    "faq6Question": "Can I use gravel instead of concrete?",
    "faq6Answer": "Yes, gravel driveways and patios are cost-effective alternatives to concrete. Gravel costs $1-3 per square foot vs. $4-8 for concrete. However, gravel requires periodic maintenance and replenishment.",
    "faq7Question": "How do I calculate gravel for irregular shapes?",
    "faq7Answer": "For irregular shapes, divide the area into rectangles and circles, calculate each separately, then add them together. For curves, use the average width. Always add 15% extra for irregular edges.",
    "faq8Question": "What's the difference between crushed stone and gravel?",
    "faq8Answer": "Crushed stone is mechanically broken with angular edges that interlock when compacted. Gravel refers to naturally rounded stones. Crushed stone is better for driveways and foundations; round gravel is better for decorative use."
