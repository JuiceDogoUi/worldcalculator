    "whatIsContent": "Calculating drywall requirements is essential for any renovation or construction project. Whether you're finishing a basement, adding a room, or remodeling, knowing exactly how many sheets of drywall you need prevents costly trips back to the store or project delays. Drywall (also called sheetrock or gypsum board) comes in standard sizes of 4×8, 4×10, and 4×12 feet. Our calculator helps you determine the total sheets needed, plus essential materials like joint compound, tape, and screws.",
    "formulasTitle": "Drywall Calculation Formulas",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How many sheets of drywall do I need for a 12x12 room?",
    "faq1Answer": "For a 12×12 ft room with 8 ft ceilings, the wall area is 384 sq ft. After deducting for a door (~21 sq ft) and 2 windows (~30 sq ft), you have 333 sq ft. With 10% waste, that's 367 sq ft, requiring 12 sheets of 4×8 drywall. For ceiling coverage, add another 5 sheets.",
    "faq2Question": "What size drywall sheets should I use?",
    "faq2Answer": "For 8-foot ceilings, use 4×8 sheets vertically or 4×12 sheets horizontally for fewer seams. For 9-10 foot ceilings, 4×10 or 4×12 sheets work best. Fewer seams mean less taping and faster installation.",
    "faq3Question": "How much joint compound do I need?",
    "faq3Answer": "Plan on about 1 gallon of joint compound per 200 sq ft of drywall. This accounts for three coats: bedding, filling, and finishing. A typical 12×12 room needs approximately 2-3 gallons.",
    "faq4Question": "How many screws per sheet of drywall?",
    "faq4Answer": "Use approximately 32-48 screws per 4×8 sheet. Space screws every 8\" along edges and every 12\" in the field (middle of sheet). For ceilings, reduce spacing to 7\" for edges and 8\" in the field.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I hang drywall myself?",
    "faq5Answer": "Wall drywall is a common DIY project with a helper. Ceiling drywall requires more skill and ideally a drywall lift. Taping and finishing take practice to achieve smooth results. Consider hiring a professional for visible areas.",
    "faq6Question": "What's the difference between 1/2\" and 5/8\" drywall?",
    "faq6Answer": "1/2\" is standard for most walls. 5/8\" provides better soundproofing, fire resistance, and rigidity - required for ceilings with 24\" joist spacing and for fire-rated assemblies. 5/8\" is also less likely to sag on ceilings.",
    "faq7Question": "How do I calculate drywall for ceiling?",
    "faq7Answer": "For ceiling drywall, calculate Length × Width of the room. A 12×12 ft room has 144 sq ft of ceiling. Divide by sheet size (32 sq ft for 4×8) to get 4.5 sheets, rounded up to 5 sheets. Add 10% waste.",
    "faq8Question": "Do I need to use corner bead?",
    "faq8Answer": "Yes, corner bead is required for all outside corners to provide a straight, durable edge. Metal or paper-faced bead can be used. Plan for the full height of each corner, plus any transitions or window returns."
