    "whatIsTitle": "What is Square Footage?",
    "whatIsContent": "Square footage is a measurement of area expressed in square feet (sq ft). It's the standard unit for measuring floor space, land area, and surface coverage in the United States and is essential for construction, real estate, flooring, painting, and landscaping projects. Understanding square footage helps you estimate materials, compare property sizes, and plan renovation projects accurately.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How do I calculate square footage of a room?",
    "faq1Answer": "Measure the length and width of the room in feet, then multiply them together. For example, a room that is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide has 120 square feet (12 × 10 = 120 sq ft). For rooms with alcoves or closets, measure each section separately and add them together.",
    "faq2Question": "How many square feet is a 12×12 room?",
    "faq2Answer": "A 12×12 room is 144 square feet (12 × 12 = 144 sq ft). This is a standard bedroom size and equals exactly 16 square yards or about 13.4 square meters.",
    "faq3Question": "How do I convert square feet to square meters?",
    "faq3Answer": "To convert square feet to square meters, multiply by 0.0929. For example, 100 sq ft × 0.0929 = 9.29 sq m. To convert square meters to square feet, multiply by 10.764.",
    "faq4Question": "How much paint do I need per square foot?",
    "faq4Answer": "One gallon of paint typically covers 350-400 square feet with one coat. For two coats (recommended), divide your wall area by 175-200 to get the number of gallons needed. Remember to subtract window and door areas from your total.",
    "faq5Question": "How do I calculate square footage for flooring?",
    "faq5Answer": "Measure the length and width of each room in feet and multiply them. Add up all room totals for your house total. Then add 10% for standard installations or up to 20% for diagonal patterns or complex layouts to account for cuts and waste.",
    "faq6Question": "What is the difference between square feet and linear feet?",
    "faq6Answer": "Square feet measure area (two dimensions: length × width), while linear feet measure length only (one dimension). For example, a 10-foot-long board is 10 linear feet. If that board is also 1 foot wide, its area is 10 square feet.",
    "faq7Question": "How do I calculate square footage for an L-shaped room?",
    "faq7Answer": "Divide the L-shaped room into two rectangles. Measure and calculate the area of each rectangle separately, then add them together. Our L-shape option in the calculator does this automatically for you.",
    "faq8Question": "How many square feet are in an acre?",
    "faq8Answer": "One acre equals 43,560 square feet. This is roughly the size of a football field (which is 57,600 sq ft including end zones). To convert acres to square feet, multiply by 43,560."
