    "whatIsContent": "Calculating concrete requirements is essential for any construction project. Whether you're pouring a patio, setting fence posts, or building a foundation, knowing exactly how much concrete you need prevents costly over-ordering or project-delaying shortages. Concrete is measured in cubic yards (in the US) or cubic meters (metric), and our calculator converts your dimensions into the exact volume needed, including a waste factor for spills, uneven ground, and over-pours.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How many bags of concrete do I need?",
    "faq1Answer": "The number of bags depends on your project volume and bag size. An 80 lb bag yields about 0.60 cubic feet. For a 4-inch thick, 10×10 ft slab (33.33 cu ft), you'd need approximately 56 bags of 80 lb concrete. Our calculator does this math automatically and shows options for 40, 60, and 80 lb bags.",
    "faq2Question": "How much concrete is in a yard?",
    "faq2Answer": "One cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet and covers approximately 80 square feet at 4 inches thick, or 65 square feet at 5 inches thick. This is enough for a typical 8×10 ft patio. Most concrete trucks deliver in full or partial yard increments.",
    "faq3Question": "How thick should a concrete slab be?",
    "faq3Answer": "Standard thickness depends on use: 4 inches for patios and walkways, 5-6 inches for driveways, and 6-8 inches for heavy vehicle traffic. Always check local building codes, as minimum thickness requirements vary by region and application.",
    "faq4Question": "Should I add more concrete for waste?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, always add 5-10% for waste. Our calculator includes an adjustable waste factor (default 10%). Waste accounts for uneven ground, spillage, over-pours, and concrete left in the mixer. For complex shapes or rough terrain, consider adding up to 15%.",
    "faq5Question": "When should I order ready-mix vs bags?",
    "faq5Answer": "For projects under 0.5 cubic yards, bags are usually more practical. For 0.5-1 cubic yard, either option works depending on access and timeline. For over 1 cubic yard, ready-mix delivery is more economical and ensures consistent quality. Ready-mix also saves significant labor time.",
    "faq6Question": "How long does concrete take to cure?",
    "faq6Answer": "Concrete reaches about 70% strength in 7 days and full strength in 28 days. You can walk on it after 24-48 hours and drive on it after 7 days. Keep it moist during the first week by spraying with water or covering with plastic to prevent cracking.",
    "faq7Question": "Do I need reinforcement in concrete?",
    "faq7Answer": "For most DIY projects like patios and walkways, wire mesh or fiber reinforcement is sufficient. Driveways benefit from wire mesh or rebar. Structural applications like foundations require rebar per engineering specifications. Reinforcement helps prevent cracking from ground movement and temperature changes.",
    "faq8Question": "What PSI concrete should I use?",
    "faq8Answer": "Standard concrete mix is 3,000-4,000 PSI, suitable for most residential projects including patios, walkways, and footings. Use 4,000-5,000 PSI for driveways and areas with vehicle traffic. High-strength applications may require 5,000+ PSI. Bagged mixes typically come in 3,500-5,000 PSI options."
