    "whatIsTitle": "What is an Age Calculator?",

    "howItWorksTitle": "How Does Age Calculation Work?",

    "feature1": "Get your precise age in years, months, and days with leap year accuracy",
    "feature2": "View age in different units: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes",
    "feature3": "Automatically determine your zodiac sign based on birth date",
    "feature4": "Find your generation: Silent, Boomer, Gen X, Millennial, Gen Z, or Alpha",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How accurate is this age calculator?",
    "faq1Answer": "This calculator is extremely accurate for dates from 1582 onwards. It correctly accounts for leap years, varying month lengths, and all calendar peculiarities.",
    "faq2Question": "Why is my age different than I thought?",
    "faq2Answer": "You may be confusing your age with your year of life. When you turn 30, you're entering your 31st year. Also, some cultures count age differently - Korean age counts you as 1 at birth.",
    "faq3Question": "What if I was born on February 29 (leap day)?",
    "faq3Answer": "The calculator will still accurately determine your age. In non-leap years, you legally age on February 28 or March 1 depending on jurisdiction.",
    "faq4Question": "How are zodiac signs determined?",
    "faq4Answer": "Zodiac signs are determined by sun position at birth according to Western astrology. Each sign corresponds to specific date ranges (Aries: March 21-April 19, etc.).",
    "faq5Question": "What are the generation classifications?",
    "faq5Answer": "Generations by birth year: Silent (1928-1945), Boomers (1946-1964), Gen X (1965-1980), Millennials (1981-1996), Gen Z (1997-2012), Gen Alpha (2013+).",
    "faq6Question": "Can I calculate someone else's age?",
    "faq6Answer": "Yes, enter any date of birth to calculate age as of today or any specified date. Useful for historical figures, eligibility checks, or pet ages.",
    "faq7Question": "How do I calculate age between two specific dates?",
    "faq7Answer": "Select a specific 'Calculate Age On' date instead of today to determine age at any point in past or future.",
    "faq8Question": "Why does my age in months seem high?",
    "faq8Answer": "Age in months is total complete months lived, not years × 12. At 25 years 7 months, you've lived ~307 months total (25×12+7).",
