    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Birthday Calculator?",
    "whatIsContent": "A birthday calculator is a specialized tool that provides comprehensive birthday information based on your date of birth. It shows when your next birthday falls, how many days until that date, what day of the week it will be, and your age on that birthday.

The calculator counts the days until that date, determines the day of the week, and identifies upcoming milestone birthdays.",

    "faq3Question": "What is a golden birthday?",

    "faq4Question": "What if I was born on February 29 (leap day)?",
