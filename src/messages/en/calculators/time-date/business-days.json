    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Business Days Calculator?",
    "whatIsContent": "A business days calculator determines the number of working days between two dates, excluding weekends and optionally public holidays. It's essential for project planning, contract deadlines, delivery estimates, service level agreements (SLAs), legal notice periods, and any situation where only business days count.",
    "howItWorksTitle": "How Does Business Day Calculation Work?",
    "howItWorksContent": "The calculator processes each day between the start and end dates, classifying them as business days (typically Monday-Friday) or non-business days (weekends). When adding business days, the calculator skips weekends and holidays, landing on the next available business day.",
    "featuresTitle": "Features",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What counts as a business day?",
    "faq1Answer": "A business day is typically Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and public holidays. The definition can vary by industry and region. For this calculator, business days default to Monday-Friday, with optional holiday exclusions.",
    "faq2Question": "How do I account for public holidays?",
    "faq2Answer": "Enable the 'Exclude Holidays' option and the calculator will skip common public holidays. Holidays vary by country and region, so verify against your local calendar for precise calculations.",
    "faq3Question": "If I add 5 business days to Friday, what date do I get?",
    "faq3Answer": "Starting from Friday and adding 5 business days: Monday (1), Tuesday (2), Wednesday (3), Thursday (4), Friday (5). You would land on the Friday of the following week, automatically skipping the weekend.",
    "faq4Question": "Does the calculation include the start and end dates?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, when calculating business days between two dates, both the start and end dates are included in the count. Monday to Friday of the same week equals 5 business days.",
    "faq5Question": "Why do business day calculations matter for deadlines?",
    "faq5Answer": "Many contracts and service agreements specify deadlines in business days. A 10-business-day deadline is actually 14 calendar days if it includes two weekends. This ensures realistic planning.",
    "faq6Question": "How do different countries define business days?",
    "faq6Answer": "Most countries use Monday-Friday. Some Middle Eastern countries use Sunday-Thursday. The number of public holidays varies widely between countries.",
    "faq7Question": "Can I use this for international project planning?",
    "faq7Answer": "Yes, but be aware that holidays and business day definitions may differ across countries. A '5 business days' deadline might mean different calendar dates depending on location.",
    "faq8Question": "What if my business operates on weekends?",
    "faq8Answer": "Some businesses operate 7 days per week. Disable 'Exclude Weekends' to count all calendar days, or manually adjust based on your specific schedule.",
