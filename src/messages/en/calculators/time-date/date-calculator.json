    "howItWorksTitle": "How Does Date Calculation Work?",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How accurate is this date calculator?",
    "faq1Answer": "This calculator is completely accurate for all dates in the Gregorian calendar (1582 onwards). It correctly handles leap years, varying month lengths, and all calendar edge cases.",
    "faq2Question": "What happens when adding months to end-of-month dates?",
    "faq2Answer": "When you add months to a date like January 31, the calculator adjusts to the last valid day of the target month. January 31 + 1 month = February 28 (or 29 in a leap year).",
    "faq3Question": "How do leap years affect date calculations?",
    "faq3Answer": "Leap years occur every 4 years (except centuries unless divisible by 400). February has 29 days in leap years. The calculator automatically accounts for this.",
    "faq4Question": "Can I calculate dates far in the past or future?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, the calculator works for any date from October 1582 (Gregorian calendar adoption) through the foreseeable future.",
    "faq5Question": "What's the difference between total days and the breakdown?",
    "faq5Answer": "Total days is the complete count (e.g., 400 days). The breakdown expresses the same period as years, months, and days (e.g., 1 year, 1 month, 5 days).",
    "faq6Question": "How do I calculate someone's exact age?",
    "faq6Answer": "Use 'Find Date Difference' mode with their birth date as start and today as end. For more detail including zodiac signs, use our Age Calculator.",
    "faq7Question": "Does this include or exclude the end date?",
    "faq7Answer": "You can choose with the 'Include end date in count' option. Enable it to count both start and end dates, disable for exclusive counting.",
    "faq8Question": "How do I subtract time from a date?",
    "faq8Answer": "Select 'Add/Subtract Time' mode, choose 'Subtract', enter the years, months, weeks, or days to subtract, and the calculator shows the resulting date.",
