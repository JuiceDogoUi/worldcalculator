    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Square Root?",
    "whatIsContent": "A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 × 4 = 16. Every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative (±4 for 16). The square root symbol (√) is called a radical. Square roots are fundamental in mathematics, appearing in geometry, algebra, physics, engineering, and many real-world applications.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the difference between a square root and a square?",
    "faq1Answer": "A square (x²) multiplies a number by itself: 4² = 16. A square root (√x) is the inverse operation that finds what number was squared: √16 = 4. They are opposite operations that undo each other.",
    "faq2Question": "Why are there two square roots (positive and negative)?",
    "faq2Answer": "Both positive and negative values produce the same square: 4² = 16 and (-4)² = 16. Therefore, 16 has two square roots: +4 and -4, written as ±4. The principal (main) square root is the positive one.",
    "faq3Question": "How do I simplify a square root?",
    "faq3Answer": "Factor the number under the radical into prime factors, then extract perfect squares. For example, √12 = √(4 × 3) = √4 × √3 = 2√3. Our calculator does this automatically and shows the prime factorization.",
    "faq4Question": "What is a perfect square?",
    "faq4Answer": "A perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, etc. These numbers have exact integer square roots. For example, √16 = 4 exactly (no decimal).",
    "faq5Question": "Can I take the square root of a negative number?",
    "faq5Answer": "No, not in the real number system. Square roots of negative numbers involve imaginary numbers (using 'i' where i² = -1). However, odd-index roots (cube root, fifth root, etc.) can be calculated for negative numbers.",
    "faq6Question": "What is an nth root?",
    "faq6Answer": "An nth root is a generalization of square roots. The nth root of a number is a value that, when raised to the power of n, gives the original number. For example, the cube root (n=3) of 27 is 3 because 3³ = 27.",
    "faq7Question": "How accurate are the decimal approximations?",
    "faq7Answer": "Our calculator provides decimal approximations to 8 significant figures, which is sufficient for most practical applications. For perfect squares and roots, exact integer values are shown.",
    "faq8Question": "What is prime factorization and why is it useful?",
    "faq8Answer": "Prime factorization breaks a number into its prime number components. For example, 12 = 2² × 3. This is useful for simplifying radicals because perfect squares (like 2² = 4) can be extracted from under the radical sign."
