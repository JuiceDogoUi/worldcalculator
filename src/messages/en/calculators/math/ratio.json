    "tip5": "Ratios can represent parts of a whole or comparison between quantities",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is a ratio?",
    "faq1Answer": "A ratio is a comparison of two quantities. It shows how many times one value contains another. Ratios are written as a:b (read as 'a to b') or as a fraction a/b. For example, if there are 2 apples and 3 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 2:3.",
    "faq2Question": "How do I simplify a ratio?",
    "faq2Answer": "To simplify a ratio, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of both terms and divide each term by it. For example, to simplify 12:18, find GCD(12,18)=6, then divide: 12÷6=2 and 18÷6=3, giving you 2:3.",
    "faq3Question": "What is the difference between a ratio and a proportion?",
    "faq3Answer": "A ratio compares two quantities (e.g., 2:3), while a proportion states that two ratios are equal (e.g., 2:3 = 4:6). Proportions are useful for finding missing values when you know three of the four terms.",
    "faq4Question": "How do I find a missing value in a proportion?",
    "faq4Answer": "Use cross-multiplication. If a:b = c:d and you need to find d, calculate d = (b×c)÷a. For example, if 2:3 = 4:?, then ? = (3×4)÷2 = 6.",
    "faq5Question": "Can ratios have decimals?",
    "faq5Answer": "Yes, ratios can include decimals. However, they are often converted to whole numbers for simplicity. To convert 1.5:2.5 to whole numbers, multiply both by 2 to get 3:5.",
    "faq6Question": "How do I convert a ratio to a percentage?",
    "faq6Answer": "Divide the first term by the second term and multiply by 100. For example, 3:4 = (3÷4)×100 = 75%. This represents the first term as a percentage of the second term.",
    "faq7Question": "What are equivalent ratios?",
    "faq7Answer": "Equivalent ratios represent the same relationship but with different numbers. For example, 1:2, 2:4, and 3:6 are all equivalent ratios. You can find equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing both terms by the same number.",
    "faq8Question": "How are ratios used in real life?",
    "faq8Answer": "Ratios are used everywhere: in cooking (recipe scaling), maps (scale ratios like 1:100000), finance (debt-to-income ratios), photography (aspect ratios like 16:9), construction (mixing concrete), and many other applications."
