    "tip5": "A fraction equals its decimal when you divide the numerator by the denominator",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How do I add fractions with different denominators?",
    "faq1Answer": "To add fractions with different denominators, first find the Least Common Denominator (LCD). Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD, then add the numerators while keeping the denominator. For example, 1/2 + 1/3: LCD is 6, so 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6.",
    "faq2Question": "What is a mixed number?",
    "faq2Answer": "A mixed number combines a whole number with a proper fraction. For example, 2 3/4 means 2 whole units plus 3/4. To calculate with mixed numbers, convert them to improper fractions first: 2 3/4 = (2×4 + 3)/4 = 11/4.",
    "faq3Question": "How do I simplify a fraction?",
    "faq3Answer": "To simplify a fraction, find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, then divide both by this number. For example, to simplify 12/18: GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, so 12/18 = 2/3.",
    "faq4Question": "What is an improper fraction?",
    "faq4Answer": "An improper fraction has a numerator larger than or equal to its denominator, like 7/4 or 5/5. These can be converted to mixed numbers: 7/4 = 1 3/4. Despite the name, improper fractions are perfectly valid and often easier to use in calculations.",
    "faq5Question": "How do I convert a fraction to a decimal?",
    "faq5Answer": "Divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75. Some fractions create repeating decimals, like 1/3 = 0.333... (repeating).",
    "faq6Question": "How do I convert a fraction to a percentage?",
    "faq6Answer": "Convert the fraction to a decimal (divide numerator by denominator), then multiply by 100. For example, 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%. Alternatively, multiply the fraction by 100: (3/4) × 100 = 75%.",
    "faq7Question": "Why do I need to flip the second fraction when dividing?",
    "faq7Answer": "Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of a/b is b/a. So a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c. This rule makes division straightforward once you understand it.",
    "faq8Question": "What is the LCD and how do I find it?",
    "faq8Answer": "LCD stands for Least Common Denominator—the smallest number that both denominators divide into evenly. Find it by listing multiples of each denominator until you find a common one, or calculate LCM (Least Common Multiple). For 1/3 and 1/4, the LCD is 12."
