    "whatIsContent": "A percentage calculator is a mathematical tool that helps you solve various percentage-related problems quickly and accurately. Percentages are used extensively in everyday life—from calculating discounts and tips to understanding financial growth, test scores, and statistical data. Our calculator supports five different calculation modes to handle any percentage problem you might encounter.",
    "modesTitle": "Calculation Modes",
    "modesIntro": "Our percentage calculator offers five powerful calculation modes:",
    "mode1": "What is X% of Y? – Find a percentage of any number (e.g., 20% of 150 = 30)",
    "mode2": "X is what % of Y? – Determine what percentage one number is of another (e.g., 30 is 20% of 150)",
    "mode3": "X is Y% of what? – Find the original number from a percentage result (e.g., 30 is 20% of 150)",
    "mode4": "Percentage Change – Calculate increase or decrease between two values (e.g., 100 to 125 = 25% increase)",
    "mode5": "Percentage Difference – Find the relative difference between two values using their average as base",

    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Percentage Calculations",
    "tip1": "Remember that 'of' in math usually means multiplication",
    "tip2": "Percentage change can be negative (decrease) or positive (increase)",
    "tip3": "Percentage difference is always positive since it measures absolute difference",
    "tip4": "To convert a decimal to percentage, multiply by 100",
    "tip5": "To convert a percentage to decimal, divide by 100",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How do I calculate a percentage of a number?",
    "faq1Answer": "To find X% of Y, multiply Y by X and divide by 100. For example, 20% of 150 = (150 × 20) ÷ 100 = 30. This is like finding a fraction of the whole number.",
    "faq2Question": "What's the difference between percentage change and percentage difference?",
    "faq2Answer": "Percentage change measures the relative change from one specific value to another (has direction: increase or decrease). Percentage difference measures how different two values are compared to their average (no direction, always positive).",
    "faq3Question": "How do I calculate percentage increase?",
    "faq3Answer": "Subtract the original value from the new value, divide by the original value, and multiply by 100. If the result is positive, it's an increase. Formula: ((New - Old) ÷ Old) × 100.",
    "faq4Question": "How do I calculate percentage decrease?",
    "faq4Answer": "Use the same formula as percentage increase. If the result is negative, it's a decrease. The absolute value tells you the percentage of decrease. For example, going from 100 to 80 is a 20% decrease.",
    "faq5Question": "Can percentages be greater than 100%?",
    "faq5Answer": "Yes! A percentage greater than 100% means the result is larger than the original reference value. For example, 200% of 50 is 100, which is double the original number.",
    "faq6Question": "What does 'percent' mean?",
    "faq6Answer": "The word 'percent' comes from Latin 'per centum' meaning 'by the hundred.' A percentage is simply a number expressed as a fraction of 100. So 25% means 25 out of 100, or 25/100 = 0.25.",
    "faq7Question": "How do I convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages?",
    "faq7Answer": "To convert a fraction to percentage: divide and multiply by 100 (1/4 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%). To convert decimal to percentage: multiply by 100 (0.75 × 100 = 75%). To convert percentage to decimal: divide by 100 (60% ÷ 100 = 0.6).",
    "faq8Question": "Why is percentage difference calculated using the average?",
    "faq8Answer": "Percentage difference uses the average of two values as the reference point because neither value is considered the 'starting' point. This makes it symmetric—the percentage difference between A and B is the same as between B and A."
