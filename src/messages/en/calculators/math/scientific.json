    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Scientific Calculator?",
    "whatIsContent": "A scientific calculator is an advanced mathematical tool that goes beyond basic arithmetic to handle complex mathematical functions. Unlike simple calculators, scientific calculators support trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, exponents, roots, factorials, and more. Our free online scientific calculator brings all these capabilities to your browser, making it perfect for students, engineers, scientists, and anyone who needs advanced mathematical computations.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What's the difference between DEG and RAD mode?",
    "faq1Answer": "DEG (degrees) mode interprets angle values as degrees (0-360°), while RAD (radians) mode interprets them as radians (0-2π). For example, sin(90) in DEG mode equals 1, while sin(π/2) in RAD mode also equals 1. Use DEG for everyday calculations and RAD for calculus and advanced mathematics.",
    "faq2Question": "How do I calculate square roots and cube roots?",
    "faq2Answer": "Click the √ button for square root or use sqrt(number). For cube root, use the ∛ button or cbrt(number). For nth roots, use the power function with a fractional exponent: x^(1/n).",
    "faq3Question": "What is the difference between log and ln?",
    "faq3Answer": "log is the common logarithm (base 10), used in engineering and general calculations. ln is the natural logarithm (base e ≈ 2.718), used in calculus, physics, and continuous growth calculations. Example: log(100) = 2, while ln(e) = 1.",
    "faq4Question": "How do I use the memory functions?",
    "faq4Answer": "M+ adds the current display value to memory. M- subtracts from memory. MR recalls the stored memory value. MC clears the memory. These are useful for multi-step calculations where you need to store intermediate results.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I use keyboard shortcuts?",
    "faq5Answer": "Yes! Use numbers 0-9 for digits, +, -, *, / for operations, Enter or = for equals, Escape for clear, Backspace to delete the last character, and parentheses ( ) for grouping.",
    "faq6Question": "What is factorial (n!) and when do I use it?",
    "faq6Answer": "Factorial (n!) is the product of all positive integers up to n. For example, 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120. It's used in probability, permutations, combinations, and statistics. Our calculator supports factorials up to 170!",
    "faq7Question": "How does order of operations work?",
    "faq7Answer": "The calculator follows standard mathematical order of operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses first, then Exponents, then Multiplication and Division (left to right), then Addition and Subtraction (left to right). Use parentheses to override the default order.",
    "faq8Question": "What are π (Pi) and e (Euler's number)?",
    "faq8Answer": "π (Pi ≈ 3.14159) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, essential for geometry and trigonometry. e (Euler's number ≈ 2.71828) is the base of natural logarithms, fundamental in calculus, compound interest, and exponential growth calculations."
