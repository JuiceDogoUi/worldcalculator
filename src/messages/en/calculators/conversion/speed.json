    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Speed Conversions",
    "tip1": "For a quick km/h to mph estimate, divide by 1.6 (or multiply mph by 1.6 for km/h)",
    "tip2": "Knots are approximately 1.15 mph or 1.85 km/h - useful for quick mental calculations",
    "tip3": "1 m/s equals 3.6 km/h exactly - a handy conversion factor to remember",
    "tip4": "The speed of sound at sea level is approximately 343 m/s, 1,234 km/h, or 767 mph",
    "tip5": "When comparing athletic speeds, remember that elite marathon runners average about 20 km/h (12.4 mph)",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How do I convert km/h to mph?",
    "faq1Answer": "To convert kilometers per hour to miles per hour, divide the km/h value by 1.60934. For example, 100 km/h equals approximately 62.14 mph. Our converter does this calculation automatically and shows the precise result.",
    "faq2Question": "What is the difference between speed and velocity?",
    "faq2Answer": "In everyday use, speed and velocity are often used interchangeably. Technically, speed is a scalar quantity (just magnitude), while velocity is a vector (magnitude plus direction). For unit conversions, they're treated the same way since we're only dealing with the magnitude.",
    "faq3Question": "Why do ships and aircraft use knots?",
    "faq3Answer": "Knots are based on nautical miles, which are directly related to the Earth's geometry (one nautical mile equals one minute of latitude). This makes navigation calculations simpler, as distances on nautical charts correspond directly to latitude readings. One knot equals one nautical mile per hour.",
    "faq4Question": "What is the most accurate speed unit?",
    "faq4Answer": "Meters per second (m/s) is the SI base unit for speed and is used in scientific contexts for its precision and universality. However, 'accuracy' depends on context - all units can express speed with equal precision; they're just different scales for measuring the same phenomenon.",
    "faq5Question": "How fast is Mach 1?",
    "faq5Answer": "Mach 1 is the speed of sound, which varies with temperature and altitude. At sea level and 20 degrees Celsius, Mach 1 is approximately 343 m/s, 1,234 km/h, or 767 mph. The Mach number is not a fixed speed unit but a ratio of speed to the local speed of sound.",
    "faq6Question": "What speed unit do European countries use?",
    "faq6Answer": "Most European countries use kilometers per hour (km/h) for road speeds and daily use. The UK is an exception, using miles per hour (mph) for road traffic. For scientific work, meters per second (m/s) is the international standard.",
    "faq7Question": "How do I convert wind speed from knots to km/h?",
    "faq7Answer": "To convert knots to km/h, multiply by 1.852. For example, 20 knots equals 37.04 km/h. This is useful when interpreting marine weather forecasts or aviation weather reports, which typically use knots.",
    "faq8Question": "Are the conversion factors exact?",
    "faq8Answer": "Most conversion factors used here are exact or defined values. For example, 1 mile is exactly 1.609344 kilometers, and 1 nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kilometers. The m/s is the SI base unit, so other conversions are derived from these defined relationships."
