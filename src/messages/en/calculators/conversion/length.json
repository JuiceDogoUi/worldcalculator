    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Length Converter?",
    "whatIsContent": "A length converter is a tool that allows you to quickly and accurately convert measurements between different units of length. Whether you need to convert meters to feet for a home improvement project, kilometers to miles for travel planning, or inches to centimeters for crafts and sewing, this converter handles all common length unit conversions. It supports both metric units (millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers) and imperial units (inches, feet, yards, miles), making it useful for people around the world regardless of which measurement system they typically use.",
    "whenToUseTitle": "When Should You Use a Length Converter?",
    "whenToUseIntro": "A length converter is essential in many everyday situations:",
    "whenToUsePoint1": "Home improvement projects - Convert room dimensions between feet and meters when following plans from different countries",
    "whenToUsePoint2": "Travel planning - Convert distances between kilometers and miles to understand map scales and driving distances",
    "whenToUsePoint3": "Online shopping - Convert product dimensions to understand the actual size of items from international sellers",

    "unitSystemsTitle": "Understanding Unit Systems",
    "metricSystemTitle": "Metric System (SI Units)",
    "metricSystemDesc": "The metric system is used by most countries worldwide. It's based on powers of 10, making conversions within the system straightforward. The base unit is the meter (m), with millimeter (mm), centimeter (cm), and kilometer (km) being common derived units.",
    "imperialSystemTitle": "Imperial System",
    "imperialSystemDesc": "The imperial system is primarily used in the United States, United Kingdom (for some measurements), and a few other countries. It includes inches, feet, yards, and miles. While less intuitive for calculations, it remains deeply embedded in everyday usage in these regions.",
    "benefitsTitle": "Why Use This Length Converter?",
    "benefit1": "Instant real-time conversion as you type - no need to click a calculate button",
    "benefit2": "See all unit conversions at once to quickly compare different measurements",

    "conversionTipsTitle": "Helpful Conversion Tips",
    "conversionTip1": "Remember: 1 inch equals exactly 2.54 centimeters - this is the official definition",
    "conversionTip2": "To roughly convert kilometers to miles, multiply by 0.6 (or divide by 1.6)",
    "conversionTip3": "A meter is approximately 3 feet 3 inches - useful for quick mental estimates",
    "conversionTip4": "For precision work, always use exact conversion factors rather than rounded approximations",
    "formulaTitle": "Conversion Formula",
    "formulaContent": "Result = Input Value x (From Unit in Meters / To Unit in Meters)",
    "formulaExample": "Example: To convert 5 feet to meters: 5 x 0.3048 = 1.524 meters. The converter uses meters as the intermediate base unit for all conversions, ensuring accuracy.",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How accurate are these conversions?",
    "faq1Answer": "Our conversions use the official international standard conversion factors. For example, 1 inch is defined as exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 yard is exactly 0.9144 meters. These are not approximations but exact definitions adopted by international agreement in 1959. The converter maintains high precision throughout calculations.",
    "faq2Question": "What is the difference between metric and imperial units?",
    "faq2Answer": "The metric system (SI units) is based on powers of 10, using meters as the base unit. It's used by most countries worldwide and is the standard for science and international trade. The imperial system uses inches, feet, yards, and miles, with less intuitive relationships between units (12 inches = 1 foot, 3 feet = 1 yard, 1760 yards = 1 mile). It's primarily used in the United States and for some purposes in the UK.",
    "faq3Question": "How do I convert meters to feet?",
    "faq3Answer": "To convert meters to feet, multiply the meter value by 3.28084. For example, 10 meters equals approximately 32.8 feet. The exact conversion factor is based on the definition that 1 foot equals exactly 0.3048 meters. Our converter handles this automatically - just enter your meter value and select feet as the target unit.",
    "faq4Question": "How many centimeters are in an inch?",
    "faq4Answer": "There are exactly 2.54 centimeters in one inch. This is not an approximation but the official definition of an inch, adopted by international agreement. To convert inches to centimeters, multiply by 2.54. To convert centimeters to inches, divide by 2.54 (or multiply by 0.3937).",
    "faq5Question": "How do I convert kilometers to miles?",
    "faq5Answer": "To convert kilometers to miles, multiply the kilometer value by 0.621371. For example, 100 kilometers equals approximately 62.14 miles. Conversely, to convert miles to kilometers, multiply by 1.60934. A quick mental approximation: kilometers multiplied by 0.6 gives a rough mile equivalent.",
    "faq6Question": "What is the relationship between feet, yards, and miles?",
    "faq6Answer": "In the imperial system: 1 foot = 12 inches, 1 yard = 3 feet = 36 inches, and 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet. These relationships are historical and not based on powers of 10 like the metric system. A mile was originally defined as 1,000 Roman paces (mille passus), which is how it got its name.",
    "faq7Question": "Can I use this for scientific calculations?",
    "faq7Answer": "Yes, this converter is suitable for scientific and engineering calculations. It uses exact conversion factors as defined by international standards. However, for extremely precise scientific work, be aware of significant figures in your input values. The converter maintains high internal precision but may round displayed results for readability.",
    "faq8Question": "Why does the world use different measurement systems?",
    "faq8Answer": "The metric system was developed in France during the 1790s and has since been adopted by most countries. The United States largely retained the imperial system from British colonial times. While there have been efforts to metricate in the US, imperial units remain common in everyday use. The UK uses a mix of both systems. International trade and science predominantly use metric units."
