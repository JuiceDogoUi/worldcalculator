In the United States, square feet (ft\u00B2) is the standard unit for residential properties, while most other countries use square meters (m\u00B2). For larger land parcels, acres are common in the US and UK, while hectares are the international standard. When viewing international property listings, always verify which unit system is being used to avoid costly misunderstandings. A 100 m\u00B2 apartment is approximately 1,076 ft\u00B2, and a 1-acre lot equals about 4,047 m\u00B2 or 0.4 hectares.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How do I convert square feet to square meters?",
    "faq1Answer": "To convert square feet to square meters, multiply the square feet value by 0.0929. For example, 1,000 ft\u00B2 \u00D7 0.0929 = 92.9 m\u00B2. Conversely, to convert square meters to square feet, multiply by 10.764. Our converter handles this calculation instantly for you.",
    "faq2Question": "How many acres are in a hectare?",
    "faq2Answer": "One hectare equals approximately 2.471 acres. Conversely, one acre equals approximately 0.4047 hectares. Hectares are the preferred unit for land measurement in most countries outside the United States and United Kingdom.",
    "faq3Question": "What's the difference between a hectare and an acre?",
    "faq3Answer": "A hectare is larger than an acre - one hectare equals about 2.47 acres. Hectares are metric units equal to 10,000 square meters, while acres are imperial units equal to 43,560 square feet. Hectares are used internationally, while acres are primarily used in the US, UK, and some former British colonies.",
    "faq4Question": "How do I convert a room's area from square meters to square feet?",
    "faq4Answer": "Multiply the square meter measurement by 10.764 to get square feet. For example, a 20 m\u00B2 room equals 215.28 ft\u00B2 (20 \u00D7 10.764). This is useful when comparing apartment sizes between countries using different measurement systems.",
    "faq5Question": "What area unit is used for measuring apartments?",
    "faq5Answer": "In the United States, apartments are measured in square feet (ft\u00B2). In most other countries, including Europe, Asia, and Australia, square meters (m\u00B2) is the standard. When searching for international properties, be sure to check which unit is being used and convert if necessary.",
    "faq6Question": "How big is one square meter in square feet?",
    "faq6Answer": "One square meter equals approximately 10.764 square feet. This means a room that is 1 meter by 1 meter (1 m\u00B2) is equivalent to approximately 10.76 square feet. Understanding this conversion is essential when comparing property sizes internationally.",
    "faq7Question": "How many square feet are in an acre?",
    "faq7Answer": "One acre contains exactly 43,560 square feet. This is equivalent to approximately 4,047 square meters or about 0.405 hectares. An acre is roughly the size of a football field (without end zones), making it easier to visualize land sizes.",
    "faq8Question": "What's the best unit for measuring large land areas?",
    "faq8Answer": "For large land areas, use hectares (internationally) or acres (US/UK). Square kilometers are used for very large areas like cities or regions. For reference: small farms are often 10-50 hectares (25-125 acres), while large farms can be hundreds or thousands of hectares."
