    "text": "This macro calculator provides estimates based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation and standard activity multipliers. Individual calorie and macro needs may vary based on metabolism, genetics, medical conditions, and other factors. For personalized nutrition advice, consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional.",

    "whatIsTitle": "What is a Macro Calculator?",
    "whatIsContent": "A macro calculator is a nutrition tool that determines your daily macronutrient needs - protein, carbohydrates, and fats - based on your personal characteristics, activity level, and fitness goals. Macronutrients (\"macros\") are the three main nutrients your body needs in large amounts for energy, growth, and overall health. By calculating the right balance of macros, you can optimize your diet for weight loss, muscle building, or maintaining a healthy weight.",
    "howItWorksTitle": "How Does the Macro Calculator Work?",
    "howItWorksContent": "The macro calculator uses a three-step process to determine your daily nutritional needs:",
    "bmrFormula": "Men: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5 | Women: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161 (W=weight kg, H=height cm, A=age)",
    "tdeeExplanation": "First, it calculates your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) - the calories your body needs at rest - using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. Then, it multiplies BMR by an activity factor to get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).",
    "macroExplanation": "Finally, it adjusts calories based on your goal (deficit for weight loss, surplus for muscle gain) and distributes those calories across macronutrients according to your selected diet type. Protein and carbs provide 4 calories per gram, while fat provides 9 calories per gram.",
    "dietPresetsTitle": "Diet Type Presets",
    "dietPresetDescBalanced": "The standard macronutrient distribution recommended by most nutrition guidelines. Good for general health and moderate activity levels.",
    "dietPresetDescLowCarb": "Reduces carbohydrate intake and increases protein. Effective for weight loss and blood sugar management.",
    "dietPresetDescHighProtein": "Maximizes protein intake to support muscle growth and recovery. Ideal for athletes and those doing strength training.",
    "dietPresetDescKeto": "Very low carbohydrate, high fat diet that puts your body into ketosis. Requires careful planning and may not be suitable for everyone.",
    "goalsTitle": "Calorie Adjustments by Goal",
    "goalDescLose": "A moderate 500 calorie deficit per day, leading to approximately 0.5 kg (1 lb) weight loss per week. Safe and sustainable for most people.",
    "goalDescMaintain": "No adjustment to TDEE. Ideal for maintaining current weight while potentially improving body composition.",
    "goalDescGain": "A modest 300 calorie surplus to support muscle growth without excessive fat gain. Often called a \"lean bulk.\"",
    "activityLevelsTitle": "Activity Level Multipliers",
    "activityDescSedentary": "Little to no exercise. Desk job with minimal physical activity throughout the day.",
    "activityDescLightlyActive": "Light exercise or sports 1-3 days per week. Some walking or light activity daily.",
    "activityDescModeratelyActive": "Moderate exercise or sports 3-5 days per week. Regular gym attendance or active lifestyle.",
    "activityDescVeryActive": "Hard exercise or sports 6-7 days per week. High training volume or physically demanding job.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What are macros and why do they matter?",
    "faq1Answer": "Macros (macronutrients) are the three main nutrients your body needs in large amounts: protein for muscle building and repair, carbohydrates for energy, and fats for hormone production and nutrient absorption. The balance of macros you eat affects your energy levels, body composition, workout performance, and overall health. Tracking macros gives you more control over your nutrition than simply counting calories.",
    "faq2Question": "How accurate is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation?",
    "faq2Answer": "The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is considered the most accurate formula for estimating BMR in healthy adults, with an error margin of about 10%. It was developed in 1990 and has been validated in numerous studies. However, individual metabolism can vary due to factors like genetics, muscle mass, thyroid function, and dieting history. Use the calculation as a starting point and adjust based on your actual results over 2-4 weeks.",
    "faq3Question": "Should I eat the same macros every day?",
    "faq3Answer": "While consistency helps with tracking, some people benefit from varying their macros. \"Carb cycling\" involves eating more carbs on training days and fewer on rest days. Athletes may time more carbs around workouts for performance. For most people, maintaining consistent daily macros is simpler and equally effective. The most important factor is hitting your weekly totals and staying consistent over time.",
    "faq4Question": "How much protein do I really need?",
    "faq4Answer": "Protein needs vary based on activity level and goals. The general recommendation is 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight for active individuals. Those doing intense strength training or dieting may benefit from the higher end. For sedentary individuals, 0.8-1.0 g/kg may be sufficient. Our calculator adjusts protein based on your selected diet type, but you can use the custom option to set your own ratio.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I build muscle and lose fat at the same time?",
    "faq5Answer": "Body recomposition (building muscle while losing fat) is possible but challenging. It works best for beginners, those returning to training after a break, or people with higher body fat. It requires a slight calorie deficit with high protein intake and progressive strength training. Results are slower than focusing on one goal at a time. For most people, alternating between building and cutting phases is more effective.",
    "faq6Question": "What should I do if I'm not seeing results?",
    "faq6Answer": "First, ensure you're tracking accurately - weighing food and logging everything. If after 2-3 weeks you're not progressing, adjust calories by 100-200 in the appropriate direction. Also consider: Are you sleeping enough? Managing stress? Training consistently? Sometimes the issue isn't diet but recovery. If problems persist, consult a dietitian or doctor to rule out underlying issues.",
    "faq7Question": "Is the keto diet right for me?",
    "faq7Answer": "The ketogenic diet can be effective for weight loss and certain medical conditions, but it's not for everyone. It requires strict carb restriction (typically under 50g/day) and can cause initial side effects like fatigue and brain fog. It's not recommended for those with certain medical conditions, pregnant women, or high-performance athletes who need carbs for explosive power. Consult a healthcare provider before starting keto.",
    "faq8Question": "How do I maintain my results long-term?",
    "faq8Answer": "Long-term success comes from building sustainable habits rather than following strict diets. Once you reach your goal, gradually increase calories to maintenance level over 2-4 weeks to avoid rapid regain. Continue monitoring intake periodically but allow flexibility. Focus on whole foods, adequate protein, and regular exercise. Expect some fluctuation and adjust as needed. The goal is a lifestyle, not a temporary diet."
