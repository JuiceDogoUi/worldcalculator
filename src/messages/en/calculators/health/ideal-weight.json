    "text": "This ideal weight calculator provides estimates based on established medical formulas. Ideal weight varies significantly based on individual factors including muscle mass, bone density, age, and overall health. These calculations should be used as general guidelines only.",

    "whatIsTitle": "What is Ideal Body Weight?",
    "whatIsContent": "Ideal body weight (IBW) is a weight range considered healthy for a person based on their height and gender. Various formulas have been developed over the decades by medical researchers to estimate this optimal weight. While no single formula is universally accurate for everyone, these calculations provide useful starting points for weight management goals. The concept of ideal weight takes into account that healthy bodies come in different shapes and sizes, which is why multiple formulas exist and why body frame adjustments are often applied.",
    "formulasTitle": "Ideal Weight Formulas Explained",
    "devineDescription": "Developed by Dr. B.J. Devine in 1974, this is the most commonly used formula in clinical settings, especially for drug dosing calculations. It tends to give lower ideal weights.",
    "devineFormula": "Men: 50 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet | Women: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet",
    "robinsonDescription": "Created in 1983, the Robinson formula is considered more accurate for shorter individuals and produces results similar to the Metropolitan Life Insurance tables.",
    "robinsonFormula": "Men: 52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet | Women: 49 kg + 1.7 kg per inch over 5 feet",
    "millerDescription": "Also from 1983, the Miller formula generally produces higher ideal weights than other formulas, making it potentially more suitable for individuals with larger builds.",
    "millerFormula": "Men: 56.2 kg + 1.41 kg per inch over 5 feet | Women: 53.1 kg + 1.36 kg per inch over 5 feet",
    "hamwiDescription": "The original ideal body weight formula developed by Dr. G.J. Hamwi in 1964. It's simple to calculate and is still widely referenced in healthcare settings.",
    "hamwiFormula": "Men: 48 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet | Women: 45.5 kg + 2.2 kg per inch over 5 feet",
    "bodyFrameTitle": "Understanding Body Frame Size",
    "bodyFrameContent": "Body frame size accounts for the differences in bone structure between individuals. A person with a larger bone structure may naturally weigh more than someone with a smaller frame at the same height. Frame size adjustments typically modify ideal weight by plus or minus 10%.",
    "frameSmallDesc": "Wrist circumference less than 6\" (men) or 5.5\" (women). Ideal weight reduced by 10%.",
    "frameMediumDesc": "Average bone structure. No adjustment to calculated ideal weight.",
    "frameLargeDesc": "Wrist circumference greater than 7\" (men) or 6.5\" (women). Ideal weight increased by 10%.",
    "howToUseTitle": "How to Use This Ideal Weight Calculator",
    "howToUseStep1": "Select your gender (male or female) as formulas differ between sexes",
    "howToUseStep2": "Choose your preferred unit system (metric or imperial)",
    "howToUseStep3": "Enter your height using the input fields or slider",
    "howToUseStep4": "Select your body frame size (small, medium, or large)",
    "howToUseStep5": "Optionally enter your current weight to see how it compares to your ideal",
    "limitationsTitle": "Limitations of Ideal Weight Formulas",
    "limitation1": "These formulas were developed primarily using data from Caucasian populations and may not be as accurate for other ethnicities",
    "limitation2": "They don't account for muscle mass - athletes and bodybuilders may have 'ideal' weights that seem high",
    "limitation3": "Age is not considered, though body composition changes as we get older",
    "limitation4": "Individual variations in bone density, body composition, and metabolism are not factored in",
    "limitation5": "Health is more than just weight - factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and fitness level matter too",
    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Reaching Your Ideal Weight",
    "tip1": "Set realistic goals - aim for gradual, sustainable changes of 0.5-1 kg (1-2 lbs) per week",
    "tip2": "Focus on body composition rather than just the number on the scale",
    "tip3": "Combine a balanced diet with regular physical activity for best results",
    "tip4": "Use the ideal weight range as a guide, not an absolute target",
    "tip5": "Consult healthcare professionals before starting any significant weight loss or gain program",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "Which ideal weight formula is the most accurate?",
    "faq1Answer": "No single formula is universally most accurate. The Devine formula is most widely used clinically, while Robinson may be better for shorter individuals. Many healthcare providers recommend looking at the average of multiple formulas and considering BMI-based ranges for a more complete picture.",
    "faq2Question": "Why do different formulas give different results?",
    "faq2Answer": "Each formula was developed using different research populations, methodologies, and assumptions. The Devine formula was originally created for drug dosing, while others were designed specifically for ideal weight estimation. The variation in results actually reflects the reality that 'ideal' weight exists as a range rather than a single number.",
    "faq3Question": "How do I determine my body frame size?",
    "faq3Answer": "The most common method is measuring your wrist circumference. For women, a wrist under 5.5 inches indicates a small frame, 5.5-5.75 inches is medium, and over 5.75 inches is large. For men, under 6.5 inches is small, 6.5-7.5 inches is medium, and over 7.5 inches is large. You can also compare your wrist to your height using standardized charts.",
    "faq4Question": "Is ideal weight the same as healthy weight?",
    "faq4Answer": "Not necessarily. Ideal weight formulas provide mathematical estimates, while healthy weight is a broader concept that includes factors like blood markers, fitness level, and overall well-being. Someone might be slightly above their 'ideal' weight but be perfectly healthy with good muscle mass and cardiovascular fitness.",
    "faq5Question": "Do these formulas work for children and teenagers?",
    "faq5Answer": "No, these formulas are designed for adults only. Children and adolescents should use age and sex-specific growth charts (like CDC growth percentiles) to assess healthy weight, as their bodies are still developing and have different composition than adults.",
    "faq6Question": "Why is gender important in these calculations?",
    "faq6Answer": "Men and women have fundamentally different body compositions. Men typically have more muscle mass and denser bones, while women have higher essential body fat percentages. These biological differences mean that healthy weight ranges differ between sexes at the same height.",
    "faq7Question": "How often should I check my ideal weight?",
    "faq7Answer": "Your ideal weight range doesn't change unless your height changes significantly. However, comparing your current weight to your ideal periodically (monthly or quarterly) can help track progress toward weight goals. Focus on long-term trends rather than daily fluctuations.",
    "faq8Question": "What if I'm outside my ideal weight range?",
    "faq8Answer": "Being outside the ideal range doesn't automatically mean you're unhealthy. If you're significantly above or below, consult with a healthcare provider who can assess your overall health, body composition, and help create a personalized plan if needed. Small deviations from ideal weight are normal and expected."
