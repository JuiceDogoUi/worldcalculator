    "whatIsTitle": "What is Body Fat Percentage?",
    "whatIsContent": "Body fat percentage is the proportion of your total body weight that consists of fat tissue. It's a more accurate measure of fitness than weight alone because it accounts for the difference between fat mass and lean mass (muscle, bone, organs, and water). Understanding your body fat percentage can help you set realistic fitness goals and track your progress more effectively than the scale alone.",
    "howToCalculateTitle": "How is Body Fat Calculated?",
    "howToCalculateContent": "This calculator uses the U.S. Navy method developed by Hodgdon and Beckett in 1984. It estimates body fat percentage using circumference measurements of the neck, waist, and hips (for women). The formulas use logarithmic calculations based on these measurements and height.",
    "howToCalculateFormulaMen": "Men: BF% = 86.010 x log10(waist - neck) - 70.041 x log10(height) + 36.76",
    "howToCalculateFormulaWomen": "Women: BF% = 163.205 x log10(waist + hip - neck) - 97.684 x log10(height) - 78.387",

    "howToMeasureTitle": "How to Take Accurate Measurements",
    "howToMeasureStep1": "Neck: Measure below the larynx (Adam's apple) with the tape slightly sloping downward to the front. Keep the tape snug but not tight.",
    "howToMeasureStep2": "Waist (Men): Measure at the navel level horizontally. Stand relaxed and don't suck in your stomach.",
    "howToMeasureStep3": "Waist (Women): Measure at the narrowest point of your natural waist, typically just above the belly button.",
    "howToMeasureStep4": "Hips (Women only): Measure at the widest point of your hips and buttocks with feet together.",
    "howToMeasureStep5": "Take measurements in the morning before eating, after using the restroom. Measure directly on skin for best accuracy.",
    "limitationsTitle": "Limitations of the Navy Method",
    "limitation1": "Estimates may be less accurate for very muscular individuals or those with unusual body proportions",
    "limitation2": "Results can vary by 3-4% compared to more precise methods like DEXA or hydrostatic weighing",
    "limitation3": "Measurement accuracy depends on proper technique and consistent placement",
    "limitation4": "May not account for individual variations in fat distribution",
    "limitation5": "Not suitable for children, pregnant women, or individuals with certain medical conditions",
    "howToUseTitle": "How to Use This Calculator",
    "howToUseStep1": "Select your gender - this determines which formula is used and whether hip measurement is needed",
    "howToUseStep2": "Enter your age (must be 18 or older)",
    "howToUseStep3": "Choose your preferred unit system (metric or imperial) and enter your height and weight",
    "howToUseStep4": "Take and enter your circumference measurements (neck, waist, and hips for women)",

    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Reducing Body Fat",
    "tip1": "Create a moderate caloric deficit through a combination of diet and exercise",
    "tip2": "Include strength training to preserve muscle mass while losing fat",
    "tip3": "Prioritize protein intake (0.7-1g per pound of body weight) to support muscle retention",
    "tip4": "Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours) as poor sleep can hinder fat loss",
    "tip5": "Be patient - aim for 0.5-1% body fat loss per month for sustainable results",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How accurate is the Navy body fat calculator?",
    "faq1Answer": "The U.S. Navy method is generally accurate within 3-4% of more precise methods like DEXA scans. While not perfect, it provides a good estimate for tracking changes over time. For the most accurate results, take measurements consistently at the same time of day and follow proper measurement techniques.",
    "faq2Question": "What is a healthy body fat percentage?",
    "faq2Answer": "Healthy body fat ranges differ by gender. For men, 14-24% is considered acceptable to fit, with 6-13% being athletic. For women, 21-31% is acceptable to fit, with 14-20% being athletic. Essential fat levels (2-5% for men, 10-13% for women) should not be maintained long-term.",
    "faq3Question": "Why is body fat percentage better than BMI?",
    "faq3Answer": "Body fat percentage directly measures fat tissue, while BMI only considers height and weight. This means muscular individuals may have a high BMI but healthy body fat, while those with little muscle could have normal BMI but high body fat (often called 'skinny fat'). Body fat percentage gives a more complete picture of body composition.",
    "faq4Question": "Can I lose fat without losing muscle?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes! To preserve muscle while losing fat: maintain a moderate caloric deficit (not too extreme), eat adequate protein (0.7-1g per pound of body weight), perform resistance training, and ensure proper recovery. Rapid weight loss typically results in significant muscle loss.",
    "faq5Question": "How often should I measure body fat?",
    "faq5Answer": "Measure body fat every 2-4 weeks rather than daily. Body composition changes slowly, and daily measurements can be misleading due to water retention and other factors. Track trends over time rather than focusing on individual measurements.",
    "faq6Question": "Why do women have higher essential fat?",
    "faq6Answer": "Women require higher essential fat (10-13% vs 2-5% for men) due to reproductive functions, hormonal regulation, and breast tissue. Very low body fat in women can lead to amenorrhea (loss of menstruation), bone density loss, and other health issues.",
    "faq7Question": "Is it possible to have too little body fat?",
    "faq7Answer": "Yes. Essential fat is required for normal physiological function. Going below essential levels can cause hormonal disruption, weakened immunity, decreased athletic performance, organ damage, and in severe cases, death. Extremely low body fat should only be achieved temporarily for competitions under professional guidance.",
    "faq8Question": "Why does the formula need hip measurement for women?",
    "faq8Answer": "Women store fat differently than men, with more fat typically deposited around the hips and thighs (gynoid pattern) compared to men's abdominal storage (android pattern). Including hip circumference improves accuracy by accounting for these sex-specific fat distribution patterns."
