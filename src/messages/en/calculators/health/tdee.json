    "whatIsTitle": "What is TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)?",
    "whatIsContent": "Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories your body burns in a 24-hour period. It includes your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) - the calories burned at complete rest - plus the energy used for physical activity, digestion (thermic effect of food), and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). Understanding your TDEE is essential for weight management: eat fewer calories to lose weight, eat more to gain weight, or match your TDEE to maintain your current weight.",
    "howItWorksTitle": "How TDEE is Calculated",
    "howItWorksContent": "TDEE is calculated in two steps. First, we calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using formulas that account for your age, sex, height, and weight. Then, we multiply your BMR by an activity factor that reflects your typical daily activity level. The result is your estimated total daily calorie expenditure. BMR typically accounts for 60-70% of TDEE, while physical activity contributes 20-30%, and the thermic effect of food adds about 10%.",
    "bmrFormulasTitle": "BMR Calculation Formulas",
    "mifflinName": "Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (Recommended)",
    "mifflinFormula": "Men: BMR = (10 × weight[kg]) + (6.25 × height[cm]) - (5 × age) + 5\nWomen: BMR = (10 × weight[kg]) + (6.25 × height[cm]) - (5 × age) - 161",
    "mifflinDescription": "Developed in 1990, the Mifflin-St Jeor equation is considered the most accurate BMR formula for the general population. Studies show it estimates actual BMR within 10% for most people, making it the preferred choice for nutritional planning.",
    "harrisName": "Harris-Benedict Equation",
    "harrisFormula": "Men: BMR = (13.397 × weight[kg]) + (4.799 × height[cm]) - (5.677 × age) + 88.362\nWomen: BMR = (9.247 × weight[kg]) + (3.098 × height[cm]) - (4.330 × age) + 447.593",
    "harrisDescription": "Originally developed in 1919 and revised in 1984, the Harris-Benedict equation was the standard for decades. It tends to slightly overestimate BMR, especially in obese individuals, but remains a valid option for comparison.",
    "katchName": "Katch-McArdle Formula",
    "katchFormula": "BMR = 370 + (21.6 × Lean Body Mass[kg])\nwhere Lean Body Mass = weight × (1 - body fat % / 100)",
    "katchDescription": "The Katch-McArdle formula uses lean body mass instead of total weight, making it more accurate for people who know their body fat percentage. It's particularly useful for athletes and those with above or below average muscle mass.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What's the difference between BMR and TDEE?",
    "faq1Answer": "BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the number of calories your body burns at complete rest - just to maintain vital functions like breathing, circulation, and cell production. TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) includes BMR plus all additional calories burned through physical activity, digestion, and daily movement. BMR is typically 60-70% of your TDEE.",
    "faq2Question": "Which BMR formula is most accurate?",
    "faq2Answer": "The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is considered the most accurate for the general population and is recommended by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. If you know your body fat percentage and are relatively lean, the Katch-McArdle formula may be more accurate as it accounts for muscle mass, which burns more calories than fat.",
    "faq3Question": "How many calories should I eat to lose weight?",
    "faq3Answer": "For sustainable weight loss, aim for a calorie deficit of 250-500 calories below your TDEE. This typically results in losing 0.25-0.5 kg (0.5-1 lb) per week. Larger deficits can lead to muscle loss, metabolic adaptation, and are harder to maintain. Never go below 1,200 calories for women or 1,500 for men without medical supervision.",
    "faq4Question": "Why might my actual calorie needs differ from the calculated TDEE?",
    "faq4Answer": "TDEE calculations are estimates based on averages. Your actual needs may differ due to: genetics and metabolic efficiency, body composition (muscle burns more than fat), hormonal factors, medical conditions, medications, sleep quality, stress levels, and climate. Use your calculated TDEE as a starting point and adjust based on real-world results.",
    "faq5Question": "How often should I recalculate my TDEE?",
    "faq5Answer": "Recalculate your TDEE every time you lose or gain 10-15 lbs (5-7 kg), change your activity level significantly, or every 3-6 months. As your weight changes, your body requires different amounts of energy to maintain itself. Also recalculate after major life changes like starting a new job or exercise program.",
    "faq6Question": "What activity level should I choose?",
    "faq6Answer": "Most people overestimate their activity level. If you have a desk job and exercise 3x per week, you're likely 'Lightly Active'. Choose 'Moderately Active' only if you exercise intensely most days or have a somewhat physical job. 'Very Active' and above are typically for manual laborers, professional athletes, or those who exercise vigorously daily.",
    "faq7Question": "Should I eat back calories burned from exercise?",
    "faq7Answer": "Your TDEE already accounts for your typical exercise routine through the activity multiplier. If you do an unusually intense workout, you can eat back some (not all) of those extra calories. Be cautious - fitness trackers often overestimate calories burned. For weight loss, it's often better not to eat back exercise calories.",
    "faq8Question": "What are the best macronutrient ratios for my goals?",
    "faq8Answer": "For general health, a balanced diet (30% protein, 40% carbs, 30% fat) works well. For weight loss, higher protein (35-40%) helps preserve muscle mass. For endurance athletes, more carbs (50-60%) support performance. For muscle building, high protein (35-40%) with adequate carbs fuels growth. The best ratio is one you can sustain long-term."
