    "text": "This BMI calculator provides estimates based on the WHO classification system. BMI is a screening tool and does not diagnose body fatness or health conditions. For a complete health assessment, consult a healthcare professional.",

    "whatIsTitle": "What is BMI (Body Mass Index)?",
    "whatIsContent": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple measurement that uses your height and weight to calculate whether your weight is healthy. Developed by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the 1830s, BMI has become the standard screening tool used by healthcare professionals worldwide to assess weight status and potential health risks. While not a direct measure of body fat, BMI provides a useful starting point for understanding your weight in relation to your height.",
    "howToCalculateTitle": "How is BMI Calculated?",
    "howToCalculateContent": "BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters. For imperial measurements, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 703, then divide by height in inches squared.",
    "howToCalculateFormula": "BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2  or  BMI = (weight(lbs) x 703) / height(in)^2",
    "categoriesTitle": "BMI Categories (WHO Classification)",
    "categoryDescUnderweight": "May indicate malnutrition, eating disorders, or other health conditions. Consult a healthcare provider if your BMI is below 18.5.",
    "categoryDescNormal": "Associated with the lowest health risks. Maintain this range through balanced nutrition and regular physical activity.",
    "categoryDescOverweight": "Slightly elevated health risks. Consider lifestyle changes including improved diet and increased physical activity.",
    "categoryDescObeseClass1": "Moderate obesity with increased health risks. Medical consultation recommended for weight management strategies.",
    "categoryDescObeseClass2": "Severe obesity with high health risks. Professional medical guidance strongly recommended.",
    "categoryDescObeseClass3": "Very severe obesity with very high health risks. Immediate medical consultation recommended for comprehensive treatment.",
    "limitationsTitle": "Limitations of BMI",
    "limitation1": "Does not distinguish between muscle and fat - athletes may have high BMI but low body fat",
    "limitation2": "Does not account for fat distribution - central obesity (belly fat) carries higher health risks",
    "limitation3": "May underestimate obesity in older adults who have lost muscle mass",
    "limitation4": "Does not account for ethnic differences in body composition and health risks",
    "limitation5": "Not suitable for children, pregnant women, or individuals with certain medical conditions",

    "tipsTitle": "Tips for Maintaining a Healthy Weight",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is a healthy BMI range?",
    "faq1Answer": "According to the World Health Organization, a healthy BMI ranges from 18.5 to 24.9. This range is associated with the lowest health risks. However, optimal BMI can vary based on age, ethnicity, and individual factors, so it's best to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.",
    "faq2Question": "Is BMI accurate for athletes and muscular people?",
    "faq2Answer": "BMI may overestimate body fat in athletes and people with high muscle mass because it doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat. A bodybuilder might have a BMI in the 'overweight' range despite having very low body fat. For such individuals, other measures like body fat percentage or waist-to-hip ratio may be more accurate indicators of health.",
    "faq3Question": "Does BMI differ by age or gender?",
    "faq3Answer": "While the same BMI formula is used for adults of all ages and genders, interpretation may vary. Older adults may have more body fat at the same BMI as younger adults. Women typically have more body fat than men at equivalent BMI values. Some healthcare providers use age and gender-specific charts for more accurate assessments.",
    "faq4Question": "How often should I check my BMI?",
    "faq4Answer": "For most adults, checking BMI every few months is sufficient. Focus on long-term trends rather than daily fluctuations. If you're actively working on weight management, monthly checks can help track progress. Always combine BMI checks with other health indicators and regular medical checkups.",
    "faq5Question": "Can children use this BMI calculator?",
    "faq5Answer": "This calculator is designed for adults (18+). Children and teenagers have different BMI interpretations based on age and sex percentiles. The CDC provides specific BMI calculators for children that account for growth patterns. Consult a pediatrician for proper assessment of a child's weight status.",
    "faq6Question": "What health risks are associated with high BMI?",
    "faq6Answer": "Higher BMI is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and fatty liver disease. However, BMI alone doesn't determine health - factors like diet quality, physical activity, stress levels, and genetics also play important roles.",
    "faq7Question": "What health risks are associated with low BMI?",
    "faq7Answer": "Being underweight (BMI below 18.5) can indicate malnutrition, weakened immune system, osteoporosis, and fertility issues. It may also be a sign of underlying health conditions such as eating disorders, thyroid problems, or digestive issues. If your BMI is consistently low, consult a healthcare provider.",
    "faq8Question": "How can I improve my BMI?",
    "faq8Answer": "To reach a healthier BMI, focus on sustainable lifestyle changes rather than crash diets. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains; engaging in regular physical activity; getting adequate sleep; and managing stress. For significant weight changes, work with healthcare professionals who can provide personalized guidance."
