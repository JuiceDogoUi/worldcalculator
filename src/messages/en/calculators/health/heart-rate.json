    "whatIsContent": "Target heart rate (THR) is the ideal heart rate range for exercise that allows you to train at the right intensity for your fitness goals. Training within specific heart rate zones helps optimize your workouts, whether you want to burn fat, improve cardiovascular health, or enhance athletic performance. By understanding your target heart rate zones, you can exercise more effectively and safely while maximizing the benefits of your training.",

    "karvonenMethodContent": "The Karvonen method is a scientifically validated formula endorsed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for calculating target heart rate. Unlike simple percentage-based methods, it accounts for your resting heart rate, making it more personalized and accurate for individuals at different fitness levels.",

    "tip5": "Your resting heart rate decreases as your fitness improves - recalculate your zones every few months",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the difference between max heart rate and target heart rate?",
    "faq1Answer": "Maximum heart rate (Max HR) is the highest number of beats your heart can achieve in one minute during maximum physical exertion. Target heart rate (THR) is a range of heart rates that you aim to maintain during exercise to achieve specific fitness goals. Your THR varies depending on your training zone and fitness objectives.",
    "faq2Question": "Is the 220-age formula accurate?",
    "faq2Answer": "The 220-age formula is a widely used estimate that works well for most adults. However, actual maximum heart rate can vary by 10-15 bpm between individuals of the same age. For precise measurements, consider a supervised maximal exercise test with a healthcare provider. The Karvonen method improves accuracy by also factoring in your resting heart rate.",
    "faq3Question": "Which zone is best for burning fat?",
    "faq3Answer": "Zone 2 (60-70% intensity) is often called the 'fat burning zone' because a higher percentage of calories burned come from fat at this intensity. However, higher intensity zones burn more total calories. For weight loss, a combination of Zone 2 training for longer sessions and Zone 3-4 intervals can be most effective.",
    "faq4Question": "How long should I exercise in each zone?",
    "faq4Answer": "For general fitness, aim for 20-60 minutes in Zones 2-3. For fat burning, 30-60 minutes in Zone 2 is ideal. Zone 4-5 training should be limited to intervals of 30 seconds to 5 minutes with recovery periods. Beginners should start with Zone 1-2 and gradually build up to higher intensity zones over weeks.",
    "faq5Question": "What if I can't reach my target heart rate?",
    "faq5Answer": "If you struggle to reach higher zones, you may need to increase exercise intensity (faster pace, steeper incline, etc.). If you're new to exercise, your cardiovascular system needs time to adapt - focus on Zone 2-3 first. If you're on beta-blockers or other heart medications, your heart rate response may be blunted; consult your doctor for modified training guidelines.",
    "faq6Question": "Can I train in Zone 5 every day?",
    "faq6Answer": "No, Zone 5 training creates significant stress on your body and requires 24-48 hours of recovery. Training at peak intensity daily increases injury risk and can lead to overtraining syndrome. Most training programs recommend Zone 5 work 1-2 times per week, with the majority of training in Zones 2-3.",
    "faq7Question": "Why is my heart rate higher than expected during exercise?",
    "faq7Answer": "Several factors can elevate your exercise heart rate: dehydration, caffeine, stress, lack of sleep, heat, altitude, or illness. Certain medications can also affect heart rate. If your heart rate is consistently much higher than expected, consider consulting a healthcare provider to rule out underlying conditions.",
    "faq8Question": "How often should I recalculate my heart rate zones?",
    "faq8Answer": "Recalculate your zones every 2-3 months, or whenever your fitness level significantly changes. As you become fitter, your resting heart rate typically decreases, which affects your heart rate reserve and training zones. Regular recalculation ensures your training remains appropriately challenging."
